# FindYourJob

FindYourJob is a modern job board web application, inspired by platforms like Indeed and LinkedIn Jobs. It allows users to browse, apply for jobs, and for recruiters (admins) to post and manage job offers.  
This project is built with React (Material UI) and uses JSON Server as a mock backend for development and testing.
